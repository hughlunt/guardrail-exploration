## Context
(*Context This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. 
These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. 
It is simply describing facts.*)
We need to record the architectural decisions made in Payments team regarding different aspects of development.

## Decision
(*We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article:* [http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions])
All the decisions made in order to improve the development cycle within Payments Team should be recorded briefly as a ADR document according to the definitions. 
The main value in an ADR should focus on the cause of the problem if there is one, the solution and the reasoning behind the decision.

***
The whole document should be one or two pages long. We will write each ADR as if it is a conversation with a future developer. 
This requires good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs. 
Bullets are acceptable only for visual style, not as an excuse for writing sentence fragments. (Bullets kill people, even PowerPoint bullets.
